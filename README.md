# Simple C# Web Server

This project is a lightweight web server built using C#. It is designed to handle HTTP requests and serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. The server includes a custom routing component that processes incoming requests and returns appropriate responses based on the requested URL.

### Features

- **Basic Routing**: Route incoming HTTP requests to appropriate handlers or static files.
- **Static File Serving**: Serve static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more.
- **Customizable Responses**: Easily modify or extend how responses are generated, including setting status codes and headers.
- **Lightweight & Simple**: Built from scratch for simplicity and easy understanding, making it a great starting point for learning about web servers.

### Usage

The server is implemented in C# and can be started with minimal setup. Just run the application, and it will begin listening for HTTP requests.

### Example

By default, the server serves an `index.html` file as the homepage and supports routing to other files.
